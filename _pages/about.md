<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, my name is Sihong He, currently a 4th-year Ph.D. student at <a href='https://www.cse.uconn.edu'> the Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>,  <a href='https://uconn.edu'>University of Connecticut</a>, working with Dr. [Fei Miao](http://feimiao.org). Before my Ph.D. journey at UConn, I received my M.S. degree in Statistics at UC Irvine and my B.E. degree in Financial Mathmatics at [SUSTech (南方科技大学)](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en) which is newly established in 2011 at Shenzhen, China. [(click to read a short story about our university)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.10631). 

I enjoy trying new things, learning new knowledge and exploring the frontiers of research (which is also a reason why I studied in three different departments during the past 10 years :blush:). There are several keywords in my research: **Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, Fairness, Uncertainty and Cyber-physical system (CPS)**.

      <p> <b>What did I do in my research?</b></p>
      <p>
        (1) I developed Machine Learning-based and Optimization-based methods for Cyber-physical systems such as Mobility-on-Demand Systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) I investigated the Robustness and Fairness issues in Cyber-physical systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) I proposed general prototype methods and conducted theoretical analysis to address Robustness and Fairness issues.
